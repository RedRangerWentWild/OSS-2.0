**AXON OSS is a smart system that indexes, categorizes, and recommends open-source projects. Think of it as "Spotify for open source"‚Äîit understands who you are as a contributor and matches you with the perfect projects and issues to grow your skills and make a real impact.**

## üéØ The Problem

Finding the right open-source project shouldn't feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. The current ecosystem is noisy, making it difficult for developers and maintainers alike.

* **üîç Poor Discoverability:** Innovative projects are buried, while only the big names get attention.
* **üß© Onboarding Friction:** Newcomers don't know where to start, as issues lack skill-level context.
* **üï≥Ô∏è Stale Contributions:** "Cookie-licking" and dead issues waste valuable contributor time.
* **üí¨ Lack of Transparency:** It's hard to know which communities are truly active and welcoming to new developers.
